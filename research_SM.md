Research on public views of biotechnology has centered on genetically modified (GM) foods. However, as the breadth of biotechnology applications grows, a better understanding of public concerns about non-agricultural biotechnology products is needed in order to develop proactive strategies to address these concerns. As an Environmental Science Policy Program [(ESPP)]("http://www.espp.msu.edu/") fellow at Michigan State University I identified this a major problem facing those working to develop biotechnology policy. Therefore, as my capstone project I conduced a survey to explore the perceived benefits and risks associated with five biotechnology products and how those perceptions translate into public opinion about the use and regulation of biotechnology.
