Since the early 1990s, breeders have used marker-assisted selection (MAS) to select lines that contain markers linked to traits of value. While MAS has been successful for certain traits, it has proved less useful in selecting for quantitative traits, like drought resistance, that are controlled by many, small-effect alleles. To breed for such traits, a new genome-wide method, called genomic selection, was established (Meuwissen et al. 2001). Genomic Selection is often favored over MAS methods because breeders do not need to know what markers are important for a trait a priori and small effect QTL can be accounted for. Since 2001, there has been an explosion in GS methods available. The methods vary in whether and how they account for non-linear interactions, population structure, differences in the effect size at each marker, and epistatic interactions between markers. Recently, deep learning based approaches have been used to predict traits from genomic data. Briefly, deep learning refers to machine learning approaches that perform layers of transformations on features to create abstraction features, known as hidden layers, which are used for the ultimate predictions. The goal of this project is to develop guidelines to help breeders determine what statistical methods to use in their GS studies.
