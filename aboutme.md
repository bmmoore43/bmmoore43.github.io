I live in East Lansing, MI, where I am a PhD candidate studying plant science and computational biology in the [Shin-Han Shiu](https://github.com/ShiuLab) lab. I enjoy working at the interface of different fields. My dissertation research touches on plant genetics, data science, predictive biology, gene regulation, genomics, and evolutionary biology. My main focus is on developing machine learning methods to predict gene function in plants.
